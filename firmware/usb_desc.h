/*
To modify a USB Type to have different interfaces, start in this
file.  Delete the XYZ_INTERFACE lines for any interfaces you
wish to remove, and copy them from another USB Type for any you
want to add.

Give each interface a unique number, and edit NUM_INTERFACE to
reflect the number of interfaces.

Within each interface, make sure it uses a unique set of endpoints.
Edit NUM_ENDPOINTS to be at least the largest endpoint number used.
Then edit the ENDPOINT*_CONFIG lines so each endpoint is configured
the proper way (transmit, receive, or both).

The CONFIG_DESC_SIZE and any XYZ_DESC_OFFSET numbers must be
edited to the correct sizes.  See usb_desc.c for the giant array
of bytes.  Someday these may be done automatically..... (but how?)

If you are using existing interfaces, the code in each file should
automatically adapt to the changes you specify.  If you need to
create a new type of interface, you'll need to write the code which
sends and receives packets, and presents an API to the user.

Finally, edit usb_inst.cpp, which creats instances of the C++
objects for each combination.

Some operating systems, especially Windows, may cache USB device
info.  Changes to the device name may not update on the same
computer unless the vendor or product ID numbers change, or the
"bcdDevice" revision code is increased.

If these instructions are missing steps or could be improved, please
let me know?  http://forum.pjrc.com/forums/4-Suggestions-amp-Bug-Reports
